# Miscellaneous Java-to-Python projects

I wrote a lot of simple Java programs back in the day in order to learn progamming and the Java language. Now, I am rewriting a lot of my old Java code in Python in order to learn this new language (well, new to me anyway).

These are a bunch of unrelated, semi-useless programs that I made just to learn things. Don't be surprised if they aren't really complex. However, they do demonstrate some useful programming concepts, so it's good for learning things.

And even though both Python and Java are primarily OOP-centric languages, these exercises show some of the differences between them.
